# COMP-350-Othello-Tournament
### A collection of abstract classes to allow different Othello/Reversi-playing AIs to compete with each other.

#### How to use it
* To integrate the base classes into your own code, first download the source code by clicking on [**Clone or download**](https://github.com/Steiffj/COMP-350-Othello-Tournament) on the main repository page (probably the page you're looking at right now) and select "Download ZIP"
  * The repository will download as a .zip archive, which you *should* be able to open using the Windows file explorer if you don't have other archiving software like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
  * Copy the [components package](https://github.com/Steiffj/COMP-350-Othello-Tournament/tree/master/Othello-Tournament/src/components) (the subfolder inside [src](https://github.com/Steiffj/COMP-350-Othello-Tournament/tree/master/Othello-Tournament/src), *not* [bin](https://github.com/Steiffj/COMP-350-Othello-Tournament/tree/master/Othello-Tournament/bin/components))
   * Paste the **components** folder into your **src** folder within your Othello Java project
    * The easiest way to do this in Eclipse is to right-click on **src** in the Package Explorer and paste the folder in (or just drag and drop)
    * Select "Copy files and folders" if prompted
* Use Eclipse (or any IDE that supports Javadoc). All the source code has lots of information that will show up in the tool tips when you start using them!
  * I'll be a little bit sad if nobody reads the Javadoc :pensive: I probably spent more time on it than on the code itself
